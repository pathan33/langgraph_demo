# Investment Committee Multi-Agent System

A multi-agent system built with LangGraph that simulates an investment committee debate between bullish and bearish perspectives, with a chairman making final investment decisions.

Reference Doc :- https://codecut.ai/building-multi-agent-ai-langgraph-tutorial/

## 🎯 Overview

This system demonstrates true agentic behavior where three AI agents debate and make investment decisions:

- **🐂 Bull Agent**: Finds positive reasons to buy stocks
- **🐻 Bear Agent**: Finds negative reasons to avoid stocks  
- **🎯 Chairman Agent**: Makes final investment decisions after hearing both sides

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-time web research** using Tavily search
- **Agentic debate** where agents counter each other's arguments
- **Multi-round discussion** with structured workflow
- **Final decision making** with reasoning
- **Interactive command-line interface**

```

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone and navigate to the directory**

   ```bash
   cd investment-committee
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys
   ```

4. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 💡 Usage

1. Start the application with `python main.py`
2. Enter any stock symbol (e.g., NVDA, TSLA, AAPL)
3. Watch the agents debate the investment merits
4. See the chairman's final decision with reasoning
5. Type 'quit' to exit

## 🔧 Configuration

- **Model settings**: Modify `src/config.py`
- **Agent prompts**: Customize prompts in `src/config.py`
- **Tool behavior**: Adjust tools in `src/tools.py`

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key
- Tavily API key (for web search)

## 🎓 Educational Purpose

This project demonstrates:

- Multi-agent system architecture with LangGraph
- Agent-to-agent communication and debate
- Real-time web search integration
- Structured decision-making workflows
- Command-line interface design

Perfect for learning how to build collaborative AI systems!
